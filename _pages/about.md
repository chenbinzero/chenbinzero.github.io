I am a Research Associate Professor at Northwestern University. I received my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Arizona State University, focusing on understanding defects in 2D materials. Before joining Northwestern, I completed postdoctoral training at the University of Toronto, where I studied perovskites, quantum dots, and their optoelectronic devices. Currently, my research centers on defect passivation and enhancing the stability of interfaces in perovskite solar cells.

I have been recognized as a Highly Cited Researcher in the Cross-Field category by Clarivate for two consecutive years (2023 and 2024). As a first or corresponding author, I have published 18 high-impact papers, including Science (3), Nature (1), Nature Energy (2), and Nature Photonics (1), contributing to a total of over 120 publications. My work has received more than 18,000 citations, with a Google Scholar h-index of 64.
